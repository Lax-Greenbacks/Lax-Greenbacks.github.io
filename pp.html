	üèà Recap is back! This week I wanted to take a look into the playoffs and see where the teams may fall. We still got a third of the season left guys, so keep up the good work! Good luck this week and set those lineups! üèà

THE LOCKS ‚úî:
<br> Miami Delgado, Salt lake Shiva, and Mow Ass Eat Grass are all teams that ESPN is giving a 95% or greater of making the playoffs. These 3 will more than likely take up half the playoffs spots and both the first round byes. These 
3 are killing it and any of them losing in the playoffs would be an upset!
<br>
<br>
SACKO BOWL üí©:
<br> We have 5 teams with a 4-6 or worse record. Only the bottom 2 teams will play for sacko so this is anyones game. If I had to guess I'd put myself and Team Fear Boner in the sacko, but who knows. The sacko plays week 15 so 
we are a short 4 weeks away from seeing whose gonna compete!

	Well it's finally time to write about myself here. Last week I dropped an impressive 45 points. The worst score of the year. After Henry went down I knew my team wouldn't be great, but I didn't realize just how bad it was. 
	Just like my Raiders it's full implosion time. My Murray/Hopkins stack has missed 2 straight weeks to injury and soon I may find myself in the sacko after a 2-0 start. And that's why I'm...... THE CRINGE PLAY OF THE WEEK.
