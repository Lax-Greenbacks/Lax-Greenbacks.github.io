        <p><strong>Frog Game</strong> - June 2023</p>
        <p>I made this game in HTML and JavaScript to put directly onto my website. Frog Game is a text-based experience that takes the player's prompts to solve some cute little puzzles. I based the game off the old fable of The Scorpion and the Frog.</p>

        <p><strong>Jurassic Portion</strong> - August 2024</p>
        <p>This project fell into my lap when someone I worked with over the summer during a game development class asked me if I wanted to be on their team for this game jam. I was pretty stoked because I’ve never participated in a game jam and I’ve been wanting to do more projects outside of class, especially with others. The jam is <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024" style="color: #2e8b57;">GMTK’s Game Jam 2024</a> hosted on itch.io.</p>

        <p>The team coordinated over Discord and we met in person on campus at 11:00 am which is when the jam started and when the theme was revealed. This video came out which unveiled the theme to be “Built to Scale”.</p>

        <div class="video-container">

        </div>

        <p>Immediately the team started to brainstorm game ideas. I really love this part of the process. You’re trying to convince a group of people to be passionate enough on something you’re coming up with on the fly. I ended up drawing this image:</p>

        <p class="label">Initial Sketch</p>
        <img src="idea.jpg" alt="Initial idea sketch">

        <p>Which we ended up going forward with and here’s the final version:</p>

        <p class="label">Final Version</p>
        <img src="finalgame.png" alt="Final game screenshot">

        <p>I love seeing these two images next to each other because that quick sketch I made really came to life! I couldn't remember what I was inspired by, until it finally dawned on me. The Mario's Slides mini game from Super Mario 64 DS!</p>

        <div class="gif-container">

        </div>

        <p>Our team, now called Dino Developers, had 48 hours to complete the game and we got right to work. We were 3 engineers (including myself) and 4 artists. The game was made in Game Maker which was good for me because I have a decent amount of experience with it already. I don’t wanna explain everything I did, but the mechanic I enjoyed making the most was the achievements in the game. The achievement idea was on our list of things that we don’t need to put in, but that we wanted to add. I REALLY wanted to add it in. So, at 3 am with 8 hours left in the jam and heavy eyes I cranked it out. The achievements added so much to the game and I’m overjoyed that they actually made it in.</p>

        <p>In conclusion I want to shout out to all my teammates who absolutely put in the work. They are all credited on the itch page and within the credits of the game itself. I love working with passionate people who love making games as much as I do. I encourage anyone reading this to please go and try the game on our page on itch: <a href="https://numa3.itch.io/jurassic-portions" style="color: #2e8b57;">Jurassic Portions</a></p>
